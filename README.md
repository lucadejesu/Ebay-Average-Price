# Ebay-Average-Price
This project will be a web scraper that can be used to return average prices from an ebay search.

The user will be able to specify the item, for primarily 'Buy it now' items, so that they know the going price for an item that they either want to buy or sell.
It will help as a tool that ensures that user is getting the true value in return for selling an item, or that they are paying an honest price.
